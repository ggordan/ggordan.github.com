<i>react-infinite-grid</i> is a <a href="http://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a> component which renders a grid of React elements. It's different because it only renders the elements that the user can see (and a small buffer) meaning that it is well suited for displaying large amounts of data. The example below has 200,000 entries.


<div id="grid"></div>
