I was working with the ["OpenCV bindings for Go":https://code.google.com/p/go-opencv/], and came across an the following issue from the get go:

{% highlight bash %}
1: error: 'CV_INPAINT_TELEA' undeclared (first use in this function)
1: note: each undeclared identifier is reported only once for each function it appears in
1: error: 'CV_INPAINT_NS' undeclared (first use in this function)
1: error: 'cvInpaint' undeclared (first use in this function)
{% endhighlight %}

After some poking around, I found that the reason for this is that the directory structure has changed for OpenCV 2.4. The solution to the problem was fairly simple. Open up terminal, and navigate to

{% highlight bash %}
cd /usr/share/go/src/pkg/code.google.com/p/go-opencv/trunk/opencv
{% endhighlight %}

This directory may differ for you, and in that case, just check your GOPATH.

Open the file opencv.h and simply comment out/delete the conditional statement at the top of the page so that you're left with only

{% highlight cpp %}
//  OpenCV 2.4.x
#   include <opencv/cv.h>
#   include <opencv/highgui.h>
#   include <opencv2/photo/photo_c.h>
#   include <opencv2/imgproc/imgproc_c.h>
{% endhighlight %}

Save the file, and that should be it.
