After a seemingly innocent kernel update to 3.5.0-27 my nvidia drivers went crazy and stopped working. Should have been simple enough to fix, but somehow after a reinstall and reboot I was stuck at a black screen with a blinking cursor and my keyboard not working so I was unable to enter a tty. In case you find yourself in a problem like this, try the following which worked for me. 
<br />
Reboot your machine and when grub pops up (hold shift) to boot into recovery mode. Select to open a root terminal when the recovery mode loads and do the following

Remove lightdm window manager and the current nvidia drivers
{% highlight bash linenos %}
apt-get remove --purge lightdm nvidia-current
{% endhighlight %}

 Keep in mind, that if you installed the nvidia drivers directly from their website, you need to download the same run file again and run it with --uninstall

{% highlight bash linenos %}
./NVIDIA_DRIVERS_YOU_INSTALLED --uninstall
{% endhighlight %}

After that, simply install lightdm and nvidia-current again
{% highlight bash linenos %}
apt-get install lightdm nvidia-current
{% endhighlight %}

And then run 
{% highlight bash linenos %}
service lightdm start
{% endhighlight %}

This method worked for me, but countless others didn't, so hopefully it works for you.
