Terms of Service; Didn't Read

It's a well known fact that the biggest lie on the internet is our agreement to the 'Terms of Service'. Every time we install new software, or start using a new service we're greeted by the all too familiar "Terms of Service" agreement, to which we most commonly agree to (the alternative being not being able to use the software).

tos-dr.info aims to provide a directory of agreements, and give you an overview of how good/bad the agreement is using its ["Classification system":http://tos-dr.info/#classification].
